Markdown to Site
================

**Markdown to Site** is a NPM package that converts a folder containing markdown files to a static website.

It automatically creates the **menu**, **search engine** and the **table of contents**. If there are **subfolders** with markdown files it will create the **submenus** accordingly.

# Demo

# How to convert markdown files to a website

```

It creates a new folder called `build` that will contains the HTML website.

Optionally, you can specify a source folder and/or a target folder:

md-to-site -b --source ~/Desktop/markdown --target ~/Desktop/docs_site
```

For more information please type `md-to-site -h` for the help.

### Notes

If you have images or other assets in your markdown folder, then you have to transfer them manually into the folder where you compiled the files.  
The author of this package did not want to copy other asset files automatically because you might not want to copy personal files.
